			<h1>WHAT'S A WHOLE GRAIN? A REFINED GRAIN?</h1><br>
			<p><b>All grains start life as whole grains.</b> In their natural state growing in the ﬁelds, whole grains are the entire seed of a plant. 
			This seed (also called a “kernel”) is made up of three edible parts – the bran, the germ, and the endosperm – 
			protected by an inedible husk that protects the kernel from assaults by sunlight, pests, water, and disease.</p><br>
			<img src = "images/wholeGrain.jpg" alt = "Whole Grain photo" id = "SideImages"/>
			<h3>What’s a “Reﬁned Grain?” An “Enriched Grain?”</h3><br>
			<p>“Reﬁned grain” is the term used to refer to grains that are not whole, because they are missing one or more of their three key parts (bran, germ, or endosperm).
			White ﬂour and white rice are reﬁned grains, for instance, because both have had their bran and germ removed, leaving only the endosperm. 
			Reﬁning a grain removes about a quarter of the protein in a grain, and half to two thirds or more of a score of nutrients,
			leaving the grain a mere shadow of its original self.</p><br>
			<p>Since the late 1800s, when new milling technology allowed the bran and germ to be easily and cheaply separated from the endosperm,
			most of the grains around the world have been eaten as reﬁned grains. This quickly led to disastrous and widespread nutrition problems,
			like the deﬁciency diseases pelagra and beri-beri.</p><br>
			</p>In response, many governments recommended or required that reﬁned grains be “enriched.” Enrichment adds back fewer than a half dozen
			of the many missing nutrients, and does so in proportions diﬀerent than they originally existed. The better solution is simply to eat whole grains,
			now that we more fully understand their huge health advantages.</p><br>

			<H3>GLUTEN FREE WHOLE GRAINS</H3><BR>
			<p>Most people ﬁnd whole grains are a delicious way to improve their health, and they enjoy the pleasures of choosing among 
			all the diﬀerent whole grains. However, the millions of people who can’t properly digest gluten must choose their grains carefully.
			Luckily for them, <b>most grains are gluten free</b>, except (Wheat-including varieties like spelt, kamut, farro and durum; and products like bulgur, 
			semolina-, Barley, Rye, Triticale).</p><br>

			<h1>WHAT ARE THE HEALTH BENEFITS?</h1><BR>
			<p>Studies show that eating whole grains instead of reﬁned grains lowers the risk of many chronic diseases. While beneﬁts are greatest with at least 3 servings daily, some studies show reduced risks from as little as one serving daily. The message: every whole grain in your diet helps!</p><br>
			Of course, these beneﬁts are most pronounced in the context of an overall healthy diet. No one food – even whole grains – will guarantee good health. It’s also important to remember that some whole grain foods are healthier than others. Plain grains — from brown rice and quinoa to wheat berries –– and whole grain pasta should be a regular feature on your table, with processed grains eaten less often. Sure a whole grain cookie is better for you than a reﬁned grain one, all other ingredients being equal — but it’s still a cookie!</p><br>
			<h3>THE MAIN BENEFITS OF WHOLE GRAIN</h3><BR>
			<p>The beneﬁts of whole grains most documented by repeated studies include:<br>
			<ul>
			<li>reduced risk of stroke </li>
			<li>reduced risk of type 2 diabetes</li>
			<li>reduced risk of heart disease</li>
			<li>better weight maintenance</li>
			<li>less inﬂammation</li>
			<li>lower risk of colorectal cancer</li>
			</ul></p><br>
